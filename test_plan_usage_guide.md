# Cat Hotel POS System - Test Plan Usage Guide

## Overview
This guide explains how to use the two complementary test plans for comprehensive testing of your Cat Hotel POS System:

1. **Core Modules Test Plan** (`test_plan_core_modules.csv`) - Tests all functionality from basic to advanced
2. **Role-Specific Test Plan** (`role_specific_test_plan.csv`) - Tests access control and permissions for each user role

## Test Plans Overview

### 1. Core Modules Test Plan
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive testing of all system functionality
- **Scope**: 12 modules × 12 test cases = 144 test cases
- **Focus**: Feature functionality, user experience, and system performance
- **Structure**: Basic → Intermediate → Advanced features for each module

### 2. Role-Specific Test Plan
- **Purpose**: Testing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and security
- **Scope**: 4 user roles × 20+ test cases = 80+ test cases
- **Focus**: Access control, permissions, and security boundaries
- **Structure**: Role-specific access testing + cross-role security testing

## User Roles Defined

### Staff Role
- **Access Level**: Limited
- **Primary Functions**: Basic POS operations, customer service, basic reporting
- **Modules**: POS System, Customer Management (view only), Basic Services, Basic Inventory
- **Permissions**: Create transactions, view customer info, basic stock checks

### Manager Role
- **Access Level**: Intermediate
- **Primary Functions**: Operational management, staff supervision, business reporting
- **Modules**: All Staff modules + Advanced POS, Full Customer Management, Service Management, Inventory Management, Staff Management (view)
- **Permissions**: Advanced operations, data modification, staff oversight

### Owner Role
- **Access Level**: High

### Admin Role
- **Access Level**: Full System
- **Primary Functions**: System administration, security management, technical operations
- **Modules**: All modules with full administrative access
- **Permissions**: Complete system control, user management, security administration

## Testing Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Functionality Testing
1. **Import Core Modules Test Plan** into Excel
2. **Start with High Priority tests** across all modules
3. **Test Basic features first**, then Intermediate, then Advanced
4. **Focus on one module at a time** for systematic testing
5. **Document all findings** and update status columns

### Phase 2: Role-Based Access Testing
1. **Import Role-Specific Test Plan** into Excel
2. **Test each role individually** (Staff → Manager → Owner → Admin)
3. **Verify access permissions** match role definitions
4. **Test security boundaries** and unauthorized access prevention
5. **Validate cross-role interactions** and data isolation

### Phase 3: Integration Testing
1. **Test module interactions** across different roles
2. **Verify data flow** respects role permissions
3. **Test system performance** under different role loads
4. **Validate security measures** and audit logging

## Test Execution Workflow

### Step 1: Environment Setup
```
1. Create test user accounts for each role
2. Prepare test data (customers, pets, services, products)
3. Set up test scenarios and use cases
4. Configure test environment with sample data
```

### Step 2: Core Functionality Testing
```
1. Login as Admin (full access for initial testing)
2. Execute Core Modules Test Plan systematically
3. Test each module from Basic → Intermediate → Advanced
4. Document bugs, issues, and improvement suggestions
5. Update test status as tests are completed
```

### Step 3: Role-Based Testing
```
1. Test Staff role access and limitations
2. Test Manager role access and permissions
3. Test Owner role access and business functions
4. Test Admin role access and system control
5. Execute cross-role security tests
```

### Step 4: Integration and Security Testing
```
1. Test role switching and session management
2. Test unauthorized access prevention
3. Test data isolation between roles
4. Test audit logging and security measures
5. Test system performance under different loads
```

## Test Data Requirements

### Customer & Pet Data
- Sample customers with different profiles
- Sample pets with various characteristics
- Vaccination records and medical history
- Customer preferences and notes

### Business Data
- Sample services and pricing
- Sample products and inventory
- Sample transactions and bookings
- Sample financial records

### User Accounts
- Test accounts for each role (Staff, Manager, Owner, Admin)
- Different permission levels and access rights
- Test scenarios for role escalation prevention

## Success Criteria

### Core Functionality
- **High Priority**: 100% pass rate required
- **Medium Priority**: 90% pass rate minimum
- **Low Priority**: 80% pass rate recommended

### Role-Based Access Control
- **Access Control**: 100% accuracy in role permissions
- **Security**: 100% prevention of unauthorized access
- **Data Isolation**: 100% proper data access restrictions
- **Audit Logging**: 100% action logging with role information

### System Performance
- **Response Time**: Acceptable performance for each role
- **Load Handling**: System stability under multiple concurrent users
- **Data Integrity**: Consistent data across all modules and roles

## Bug Reporting and Tracking

### Bug Severity Levels
- **Critical**: System crashes, data loss, security breaches
- **High**: Core functionality broken, major access control issues
- **Medium**: Important features not working, minor security concerns
- **Low**: UI issues, performance problems, minor bugs
